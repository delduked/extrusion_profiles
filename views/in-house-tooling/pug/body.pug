        p
          | While custom tooling of extrusion profile dies and sizers can be very expensive, we at EPI have learned one thing for sure. A consistent profile begins with the right tooling. As such, we have established a program that ensures you received the highest quality tooling without having to spend a fortune. Size and complexity of the profile determines cost. It is this "Tooling Charge" that is a one time deposit, which is rebated 100% at a rate of 5% on related purchases. This "Tooling Deposit" entitles the customer the exclusive right to production from the tooling, and ensures no other persons are able to purchase from that die and sizer. All tooling however remains the physical property of Extrusion Profiles Inc.
